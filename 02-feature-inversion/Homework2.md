# Homework 2
## Goals
- Learn the principle of [representation inverting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0035), i.e. approximate an image with its feature extracted from deep neural networks.

## Backgrounds
The representation inverting problem is formulated as finding an image <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x" title="$x$" /> whose representation, e.g. extracted features best match the one given.

The representation inverting problem is formulated as finding an image whose representation, e.g. extracted features, best matches the given targetï¼Œ as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x&space;=&space;argmin_{x&space;\in&space;\mathbb{R}^{H&space;\times&space;W&space;\times&space;C}}L(\Phi(x)-\Phi_0)&space;&plus;&space;\lambda&space;R(x)" title="$x = argmin_{x \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C}}L(\Phi(x)-\Phi_0) + \lambda R(x)$" />
where the loss L compares the representation of image x and that of the target <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Phi_0" title="$\Phi_0$" /> and R serves as the regularization term. 
* In this experiment we generate the representation using a pretrained vgg16 model with batch normalization added after each convolution layer from the [onnx model zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models). 
* We use L2 loss to compare the difference between representations.
* During the training process, the image <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x" title="$x$" /> gets tuned and saved per 10 epochs. 
Check the stored images and find out how well this image approximates the target.



## Tasks
- #### Q1: How learning rate helps?
  - The baseline takes constant learning rate 1e-3. Modify the learning rate curve and pick one that achieves better convergence.
    You may use this configuration as your baseline.
  
  **_Submit your code in q1.diff._**
   
- #### Q2: How regularization term helps?
   - Total variation is defined as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?&space;\sum\nolimits_{i,j}&space;(y_{i&plus;1,j}-y_{i,j})^2&space;&plus;&space;(y_{i,j&plus;1}-y_{i,j})^2" title="$ \sum\nolimits_{i,j} (y_{i+1,j}-y_{i,j})^2 + (y_{i,j+1}-y_{i,j})^2$" />
    where i,j denotes row and column index of a pixel in the image.
Total variation loss encourages images to be made up of piece-wise constant patches. 
Add total variation loss in the loss term and compare the generated images with that in Q1. 
   _Note_: You might average the total variation before adding it in the loss term. 
   **_Submit your code in q2.1.diff._**
  - Increase the portion of total variation loss in the loss term and rerun the training process.
   
   **_Submit your code in q2.2.diff._**
  - Increase the portion of feature/representation loss and rerun the training process.     
   
   **_Submit your code in q2.3.diff._**
  
- #### Q3: Which is more helpful, shallow or deep representation?
  - Use the features generated from 'conv1_1' and construct the representation loss. Rerun the training process.

  **_Submit your code in q3.1.diff._**
  - Use the features generated from 'pool5' and construct the representation loss. Rerun the training process.
   
  **_Submit your code in q3.2.diff._**
  - Construct representation loss from features from multiple layers. e.g. features from 'conv3_1' and 'fc6' and rerun the training process. 

  **_Submit your code in q3.3.diff._**

- #### Q4: What does different feature extraction model bring?
  - Change the feature extraction model from pretrained VGG16 model to [Resnet18 model](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html).
    Use the feature generated from second residual block , i.e. 'res2' to construct representation loss and rerun the training process.
   You may also play with other layes, e.g. the first convolution layer in each residual block, e.g.'middle1'.

   **_Choose one layer configuration and submit your code in q4.diff._**
